# Chl-binding
This script identifies the chlorophyll binding sites that have possible hydrogen-bond donors within a certain radius ('radius') around a pivot ('pivot') atom. Column DN corresponds to the list of atoms that are considered as possible hydrogen-bond donors and column AN corresponds to the list of possible hydrogen-bond acceptors. There is an option to exclude the backbone amide nitrogen atoms in Î±-helices ('exclude_alpha_helix') because those atoms are already engaged in hydrogen-bonding and therefore do not have a proton to donate otherwise. With the angleT option you may exclude possible hydrogen-bond donors that are on the top of the chlorophyll plan, which is defined by the Mg and the N atoms.
